1) Test working linking when switching solution configuration.

  * Clean the project in both Debug/Release targets;  
  * Switch to Release. Build;
  * Switch to Debug. Build.

It should not result in error LNK1104 of ConsoleApp not finding LibDll.lib.

2) Test reliability of switching Debug/Release

  * Switch Debug/Release plus build multiple times
